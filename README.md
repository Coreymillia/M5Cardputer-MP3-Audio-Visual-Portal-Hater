# XtraCardputer - Multi-Function Pocket Computer

## Overview
XtraCardputer transforms your M5Cardputer into a full-featured pocket computer with multiple applications accessible through an intuitive menu system.

## Features

### 🎯 Core System
- **Boot to Screensaver**: Powers on to the beautiful 28-effect screensaver
- **ESC Menu Access**: Press ESC at any time to access the main menu
- **Auto-Return**: Menu automatically returns to screensaver after 1 minute of inactivity

### 📱 Applications

1. **🎨 Screensaver** 
   - Multiple visual effects (subset of original 341 collection optimized for multi-app environment)
   - Cycles through effects automatically
   - Manual effect switching with keyboard

2. **🎵 MP3 Player**
   - Play audio files from SD card
   - **NOTE** It took about 10 to 15 minutes to scan 1,900 songs when I first entered the MP3 player. During this time the divice does not react! You have to wait for the scan to finish. It will only have to do this once. If you  add songs to your card  you  can rescan  and it should only have to scan the new ones. You should not have to but I put the mp3s in the root of my SD card. You can try to put them in a directory named Music or any folder, if you want to try. It should scan for folders. Not tested. 
   - Shuffle mode support
   - Auto-advance to next song
   - Exit with M key

3. **📡 WiFi Scanner**

## Technical Architecture

### Menu System
```
Main Menu (ESC to access)
├── 1. Screensaver
├── 2. MP3 Player  
├── 3. WiFi Scanner
├── 4. Captive Portal
├── 5. Clock & Alarm
├── 6. File Reader
└── 7. Portal Hater
```

### Input Handling
- **ESC**: Return to menu from any app
- **Arrow Keys**: Navigate menus
- **Enter**: Select menu item
- **Numbers**: Quick menu selection
- **App-specific**: Each app has custom controls

### Memory Management
- Efficient screen buffer usage
- Minimal RAM footprint per app
- SD card for data storage
- PSRAM utilization for larger operations

## Getting Started

1. Flash firmware to M5Cardputer
2. Insert SD card with music files (optional)
3. Power on - boots to screensaver
4. Press ESC to access menu system
5. Use number keys or arrows to navigate

## Contributing
This project welcomes contributions for new applications and features.

## Credits and Acknowledgments

This project builds upon and integrates code from several excellent open-source projects:

### Core Firmware Inspiration
- **[Bruce](https://github.com/pr3y/Bruce)** - Multi-tool firmware that inspired the menu system and WiFi portal functionality
- **[Nemo](https://github.com/n0xa/m5stick-nemo)** - WiFi security testing framework that contributed to beacon and portal features

### Specialized Components
- **[Open-Wifi-Scanner](https://github.com/geo-tp/Open-Wifi-Scanner)** - Enhanced WiFi scanning capabilities with signal strength and security detection
- **[Spamtastic-M5StickC-Plus2-Beacon](https://github.com/Coreymillia/Spamtastic-M5StickC-Plus2-Beacon)** - Beacon spam functionality and category system
- **[TETROIDS-M5StickC-Plus2](https://github.com/Coreymillia/TETROIDS-M5StickC-Plus2)** - Asteroids-style game ported to M5Cardputer

### Original 341 Effects Port
- **XScreensCYD Project** - Original collection of 341 visual effects, adapted for M5Cardputer hardware constraints

### Development Framework
- **PlatformIO** - Cross-platform build system
- **ESP32 Arduino Framework** - Core development platform
- **M5Cardputer Libraries** - Hardware abstraction and display drivers

### Memory Optimization Note
Due to the multi-application architecture of XtraCardputer, the full 341 visual effects collection has NOT been optimized to fit alongside games, WiFi tools, and other features. For a dedicated screensaver experience with all 341 effects, see the standalone XScreens projects.

Special thanks to the open-source community for creating the foundational tools and libraries that made this project possible.
